            <p><strong>Q: How does your website template look so organized and nice?</strong><br>
            A: I used a Bootstrap template. This website is not meant to be a way of showing off my web development skills. My focus for my website is on writing my thoughts, not on developing computer science skills. I get the high quality pictures off of <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>.</p> 

            <p><strong>Q: I got here from the CS170 website page. Your bio link says "www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts", but in the show, Creed says "backslash", not "forward slash". Why is this?</strong> <br>
            A: I agree. Creed says "backslash" when he reads out his blog name, but when it zooms up on the "blog" that Ryan created for him, you can actually see that it is a forward slash. I thought a lot about whether putting it as a forward slash or a backslash and debated it with my friends, and I decided on forward slash, because I believe it's likely that Creed doesn't know the difference between a backslash and a forward slash. Even though in the quote he says backslash. Oh, the troubles I encounter in my life.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Will you ever play in a professional table tennis tournament again outside of collegiates?</strong> <br>
            A: Probably not. Pingpong has been a big part of my life for so long, I'm now exploring different fields outside of it. Not that I've completely forgotten pingpong, but it's taken a backseat to other priorities. </p>

            <p><strong>Q: What is your obsession with The Office and Parks and Rec? </strong><br>
            A: I really like comedy shows, and the producers of these two shows are great. I like comedy shows because they are 20 minutes compared to dramas that are 40 minutes to an hour, and it doesn't require as much focus to watch. It's more of a relaxing activity for me than being spending my free time focusing on the plots of shows. It's also easier for me to rewatch shows. I've currently started watching "The Good Place" though, and it's pretty good.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: You have a lot of run-on sentences.</strong> <br>
            A: I try to write the way I talk, so sometimes it sounds good in my head when I write stuff, but it ends up being kind of crazy in writing. Also, I don't extensively edit my blog posts, so feel free to email me any grammatical errors or changes you see.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Didn't you have some other blog written by you and your friends which had a strange name, and one fella who just wrote one long runon sentence with no periods for his posts? </strong> <br>
              A: Yes. I had a blog post called <a href="https://thebubssite.wordpress.com/">The Bubs Site</a> that I ran with my friends in the year after our high school. I brought up the idea of starting a blog site with them to keep in contact about each other's lives since we were all in different places. It's currently being revamped. Probably to get out of Wordpress and it will look very similar to this blog. Since I will use the same template.</p>
