            <p>
            I did say I was going to write more, didn’t I? Truth is, everytime I start writing, I feel like it’s not good enough. Or it’s not something I want to share. Or I’m not doing the topic enough justice. But it’s just writing??? So maybe I’ll just start small. Or big.

            <h3>Top 7 Best Fruits</h3>

            <ol>
            <li>Mango. “Ermm Teddy, it’s a matter of personal choice, there is no correct ranking” wrong. If mango isn’t in your top 5 fruits, I would invite you to reconsider all of your life decisions. Or at least 3.</li>
            <li>Blackberry. Everytime I buy blackberries, I always think that it is ridiculous how much they cost. And I always finish all of them. A friend told me that I can just pick them from somewhere in SF, but I forget. But I think I could spend all of my money on blackberries and still not have enough. They are just sweet and soft and melt in your mouth. Also, Driscoll’s sweetest batch blackberries are insanely goated. </li>
            <li>Lychee. Not only is it good by itself, but whatever fruit concoction you have, throw it in there and it becomes better. Add lychee jelly to your smoothie? Amazing choice. Not only does it taste better, but you feel like a more cultured person. Probably would rank higher if there wasn’t a gigantic seed in the middle.</li>
            <li>Avocado. It goes well on toast and there’s guacamole and other related things. You get the point. Would rank higher if I would like to eat it by itself or if it didn’t have a gigantic seed in the middle.</li>
            <li>Watermelon. I have a friend who doesn’t prefer watermelon (not that he hates it) because he says it tastes like water with sugar. AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT??? But that statement also made me question if watermelon has a flavor besides water with sugar? I think it does, but I can’t pinpoint it.</li>
            <li>Peach. Today I learned that nectarine is just a type of peach without the fuzzy skin. I like the white peaches more than the yellow ones. I also don’t like soft peaches, I like when they are crunchy.</li>
            <li>Guava. I feel pretty similarly about guavas as I do peaches.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Top 4 Worst Fruits</h3>

            <ol>
            <li>Cantaloupe. Ew. Why are there so many of them in fruit mixes? Contribute something to being a fruit other than color.</li>
            <li>Honeydew. See cantaloupe.</li>
            <li>Apple. If every elementary school didn’t teach “A is for Apple” and brainwash kids into going to pick apples and showing them all of the different types of apples, nobody would like this fruit. Also, what’s up with this “core” in the middle? I hate biting into the core and it just doesn’t feel right. Couldn’t the core be solid so I know where to stop eating? Plus it’s so inconvenient to hold an apple after you finish eating it (yes, I understand that there are fruits in my favorites that have inconvenient seeds or skins you have to dispose of as well. Ask me if I care)</li>
            <li>Grapefruit. I feel like I’ve never liked a single grapefruit I’ve tried. They’ve all been so sour.</li>
            </ol>
  


            <p>
            If you’re wondering why there’s different numbers in each list, it’s because these are the fruits I wanted to write about.
            </p>


            <p>
            If you’re thinking that most fruits taste good and are pretty similar in rank, I would say that’s what makes ranking fruit hard and a challenge. News flash buddy, life is hard. If you can’t rank fruit, I don’t know how you will survive in corporate america
