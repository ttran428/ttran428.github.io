            <p>
            It’s been over 3 years since I’ve written on my blog. I remember in college when my favorite TAs had blogs and they stopped updating it and I always wondered what happened to them. Did they fall off the face of the earth? But I understand now. It’s hard to keep writing consistently, and it just took a back seat in my life and I was less interested in sharing my thoughts. I also didn’t fall off the face of the Earth, and it’s been quite a formative couple of years learning to navigate my adult life. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I want to start writing again because I am deeply interested in exploring my artistic side these days. As a writer, as a dancer, as an artist, as a performer. I've also started reading poems, which has been a lot of fun! Most of my life has been focused on aspects and activities that have concrete measurements: there’s a grading scale for classes, school rankings, pingpong ratings and awards. I think pingpong was the closest thing to art that I did, but even then, I do not think that the way I played pingpong and my approach towards it was artistic, but very technical. And now in this chapter of my life, I would like to focus on more subjective goals.
            </p>

            <p>
            And I guess my goal isn’t to become the best artist or make a career out of it, but to express myself. I do hope to get better at writing and dancing and all of these other things, but the main goal is to feel alive and to have fun.
            </p>

            <p>
            So I’ll be trying to write more. No guarantees, since this is mainly for me and perhaps I would like to keep my thoughts about things more internal. And there’s been a lot of work and school content in the past, but probably not as much in the current future. I will keep the life thoughts content.
