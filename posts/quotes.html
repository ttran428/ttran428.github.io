          <p>A lot of times I run into quotes that just stick with me. Whether they be funny, inspirational, or just memorable in some way. This is a collection of these quotes in no particular order. I'll be updating them as I experience life more! </p><hr>

          <p>“Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it.” -Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</p> <hr>
          <p><STRONG>The Starfish Story </STRONG></p>
          <p>Once upon a time, there was an old man who used to go to the ocean to do his writing. He had a habit of walking on the beach every morning before he began his work. Early one morning, he was walking along the shore after a big storm had passed and found the vast beach littered with starfish as far as the eye could see, stretching in both directions.

          <p>Off in the distance, the old man noticed a small boy approaching. As the boy walked, he paused every so often and as he grew closer, the man could see that he was occasionally bending down to pick up an object and throw it into the sea. </p>

          <p>The boy came closer still and the man called out, “Good morning! May I ask what it is that you are doing?” </p>

          <p>The young boy paused, looked up, and replied “Throwing starfish into the ocean. The tide has washed them up onto the beach and they can’t return to the sea by themselves. When the sun gets high, they will die, unless I throw them back into the water.” </p>

          <p>The old man replied, “But there must be tens of thousands of starfish on this beach. I’m afraid you won’t really be able to make much of a difference.”</p>

           <p>The boy bent down, picked up yet another starfish and threw it as far as he could into the ocean. Then he turned, smiled and said, “It made a difference to that one.”</p>

          <p>“I know very little about anything, but what I do know is that if you can live your life without an audience, you should do it.” -Bo Burnham</p><hr>

          
          <p>“Quotes are for dumb people who can’t think of something intelligent to say on their own.” -Bo Burnham</p><hr>

          <p>“One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple.”― Jack Kerouac </p><hr>

          <p>“Whatever you do in this life, it's not legendary, unless your friends are there to see it.” -Barney</p><hr>

          <p>“It’s a bad day, not a bad life.” </p><hr>
            
          <p>“The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.” -Marcel Proust</p><hr>

          <p>“I hope you’ll look back and remember today as the day you decided to make every one count, to relish each hour as if there would never be another. And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance, I hope you dance.”</p><hr>

          <p>“To go wrong in one's own way is better than to go right in someone else's.” -Dostoevsky</p><hr>

          <p>“I live in danger, Suit.” -Mozzie</p><hr>

          <p>“If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.” -Mozzie</p><hr>

          <p>“Time is money, money is power, power is pizza, pizza is knowledge.” – April Ludgate</p><hr>

          <p>“Sometimes you gotta work a little, so you can ball a lot.” -Tom Haverford</p><hr>

          <p>“Don’t start chasing applause and acclaim. That way lies madness.” – Ron Swanson</p><hr>

          <p>“The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don’t always soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don’t always spoil the good things and make them unimportant.” 
          — The Doctor, Season 5, Episode 10</p><hr>

          <p>“We’re all stories, in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?”
          — The Doctor, Season 5, Episode 13</p><hr>

         <p> “Letting it get to you. You know what that’s called? Being alive. Best thing there is. Being alive right now is all that counts.” 
          — The Doctor, Season 6, Episode 4</p><hr>

          <p>"Some people live more in twenty years than others do in eighty. It's not the time that matters, it's the person." -The Doctor </p><hr>
